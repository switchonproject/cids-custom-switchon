The data are in 0.25 degree resolution and range from 2000 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. This simulation was forced by combination of NOAA/GDAS atmospheric analysis fields, spatially and temporally disaggregated NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) fields, and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET). The simulation was initialized on 1 January 1979 using soil moisture and other state fields from a GLDAS/Noah model climatology for that day of the year.
