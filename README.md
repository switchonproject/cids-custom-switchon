SIP Expert Catalogue Management GUI
====================

The SIP Expert Catalogue Management GUI is based on the [cids-navigator](https://github.com/cismet/cids-navigator) software. This project provides the client-side customisations developed for the Spatial Information Platform (SIP) of the [SWITCH-ON](http://www.water-switch-on.eu/) project.

This video showcases the Features of the SIP and the SIP Expert Catalogue Management GUI that have been implemented in September 2014:
